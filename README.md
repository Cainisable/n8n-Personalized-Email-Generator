# n8n-Personalized-Email-Generator
A test workflow I built for a current contract. It does research on an individual and generates a suitable cold email.

This workflow conducts research on the targets organization, and their professional history, utilizing web scraping to grab their professional summary (A dedicated Linkedin scraping API would work better for this as it would pull more information more easily).

It then utilizes this information to draft a cold email that is more likely to receive a response due to leveraging the collected information.
